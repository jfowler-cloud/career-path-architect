## Why This Project

After building [Resume Tailor AI](https://github.com/jfowler-cloud/resume-tailor-ai) and [Scaffold AI](https://github.com/jfowler-cloud/scaffold-ai), I wanted to create a tool that helps professionals navigate their career growth with AI-powered insights. Career Path Architect analyzes your resume, compares it against target roles, and generates personalized learning roadmaps with actionable recommendations.

The goal was to demonstrate:

- **Extreme rapid development** -- Production-quality multi-agent system in 2 hours
- **LangGraph expertise** -- 6 specialized agents working together
- **Test-driven approach** -- 99% coverage with 142 tests from the start
- **Production mindset** -- Rate limiting, caching, validation, and security built-in

| | Resume Tailor AI | Scaffold AI | Career Path Architect |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Resume optimization | AWS architecture design | Career planning |
| **Agents** | Step Functions workflow | 4 LangGraph agents | 6 LangGraph agents |
| **Development** | 3 days | 1 day | 2 hours |
| **Tests** | 212 tests, 98% | 150+ tests | 142 tests, 99% |
| **Features** | Resume tailoring | Architecture generation | Roadmap + Critical Review |

All three projects share production patterns (validation, error handling, rate limiting, testing) -- demonstrating consistent engineering practices across different problem domains.

## 🚀 Development Speed

| Milestone | Timeline | Highlights |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| **MVP (Session 1)** | **1 Hour** | Core 5-agent system with visual roadmap generation |
| **Production Polish (Session 2)** | **1 Hour** | Critical review, fit score, dark mode, deployment modes |
| **Total** | **2 Hours** | Complete full-stack LangGraph multi-agent system with 142 tests and 99% coverage |

> This project demonstrates **extreme rapid development** using AI-assisted workflows, achieving a production-quality multi-agent system with comprehensive testing in just 2 hours (1 hour MVP + 1 hour polish).

## 📋 Overview

An intelligent career planning platform that analyzes your resume, compares it against target job descriptions, identifies skill gaps, and generates interactive visual learning roadmaps with courses, projects, and timelines. Built with LangGraph multi-agent orchestration and AWS Bedrock Claude models.

**Built for extreme rapid iteration** - leveraging LangGraph's agent framework, modern Python tooling (uv, FastAPI), and AI-assisted development, this project went from concept to production-ready MVP in just 2 hours with 99% test coverage.

### My Philosophy: Honest Career Growth Through Actionable Insights

> **This tool isn't about gaming the system—it's about genuine skill development.**
>
> I built Career Path Architect to give you a clear, honest assessment of where you are and exactly what you need to learn to get where you want to go. It doesn't sugarcoat gaps or make false promises—it gives you a roadmap based on real skill requirements.
>
> **What this tool does:**
> - Analyzes your actual skills and experience from your resume
> - Identifies genuine gaps between your skills and target roles
> - Prioritizes what to learn based on importance and difficulty
> - Recommends specific courses, projects, and certifications
> - Creates a realistic timeline for skill development
> - Generates visual roadmaps to track your progress
>
> **What this tool does NOT do:**
> - Pretend you have skills you don't
> - Suggest shortcuts that skip real learning
> - Make unrealistic promises about career transitions
> - Hide the work required to reach your goals
